# .research/

Freeform space for research, discovery, and exploration artifacts that don't belong in `.planning/` (which is phase/milestone-oriented and structured).

## What belongs here

- Discovery scripts (e.g., probing JMAP EventSource behavior)
- Personal notes and findings from exploration sessions
- Historical context (e.g., the original project brief)
- Exploratory prototypes and throwaway code
- API response samples, curl logs, protocol notes

## Organization

Organize by theme, not by type. For example, a JMAP EventSource exploration would live in `.research/jmap-eventsource/` and contain both scripts and notes together.

## Conventions

There are no strict conventions. This directory is lightweight and free-form. The only rule is: commit everything to git so it travels with the repo.
