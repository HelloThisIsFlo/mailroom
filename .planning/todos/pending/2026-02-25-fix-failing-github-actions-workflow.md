title: Fix failing GitHub Actions workflow

## Problem

The GitHub Actions CI workflow is failing. The root cause has not been identified yet — the user has the raw logs and will provide them for analysis. This needs investigation to restore CI/CD pipeline health.

## Solution

TBD — analyze the raw failure logs to identify the root cause and apply the appropriate fix (could be dependency issues, test failures, configuration drift, etc.).
