<objective>
Create the marketing showcase page as a single-file HTML document with an animated CSS workflow demo, feature cards, and product-quality design.

Purpose: This is the public face of Mailroom — a product marketing page that "sells" the project. It should feel like a SaaS landing page, not a developer README. The animated workflow demo is the centerpiece that communicates the core value proposition.
Output: docs/index.html

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build the showcase page with animated workflow demo</name>
  <files>docs/index.html</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/index.html` as a single self-contained HTML file with ALL CSS and JS inline. No external dependencies except system fonts. No build step.

**Structure (sections in this order per user decision):**

1. **Hero + Tagline**:
   - Project name "Mailroom" prominently displayed
   - Tagline: "One-label email triage for Fastmail"
   - Subtitle: 1-2 sentences about bringing HEY/Google Inbox triage workflows to Fastmail
   - "View on GitHub" CTA button linking to `https://github.com/HelloThisIsFlo/mailroom`
   - Branding: Fastmail-specific ("for Fastmail")

2. **Animated Workflow Demo** (centerpiece):
   Design a clear, immediately understandable animation showing the triage flow. Use a simplified inbox UI metaphor (per research recommendation):

   - **Scene**: Show a simplified email list (2-3 email rows with sender names in a "Screener" inbox view)
   - **Step 1**: Email sits in Screener (static, visible)
   - **Step 2**: User taps a triage label — show a label badge (e.g., "@ToImbox") appearing on the email with a scale animation
   - **Step 3**: Mailroom processes — show a processing indicator, then the contact being created (a contact card appearing) and the email sliding to a destination column/area labeled "Imbox"
   - **Step 4**: Result state — show "Future emails auto-route" with a new email from the same sender going directly to Imbox (bypassing Screener)

   **Animation technique:**
   - Pure CSS `@keyframes` with `animation-delay` for choreography
   - `animation-fill-mode: forwards` so each step holds its end state
   - The animation should loop with a pause (e.g., 12-15s total cycle, 3s pause at end before restart)
   - Use `IntersectionObserver` (~10 lines vanilla JS) to start the animation when scrolled into view
   - Respect `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` — show static final state instead

3. **Feature Highlights** (3-4 cards):
   - **Smart Triage**: One label routes an entire sender — all backlogged emails move, future emails auto-route
   - **Contact Intelligence**: Automatically creates contacts (company or person type) and assigns to groups
   - **Retry Safety**: If something fails, the label stays put. Next poll picks it up automatically.
   - **Fully Configurable**: Labels, groups, polling interval — all customizable via environment variables

4. **"Coming Soon" / "Extendable" Teaser**:
   - Brief section hinting at future capabilities (hosted service, rule builder UI, multi-provider)
   - Keep it aspirational, not committal
   - "And more coming..." or "Built to grow" vibe

5. **Footer**:
   - "Built by Flo" (per user decision)
   - NO GSD mention (per user decision — this is product marketing)

**Design specs (Claude's discretion on details, but follow these guidelines):**

- **Color palette** from research recommendation:
  ```
  --bg: #FAFAFA (light clean base)
  --surface: #FFFFFF
  --text-primary: #1A1A2E (dark navy)
  --text-secondary: #6B7280
  --accent: #FF6B35 (warm coral/orange)
  --accent-light: #FFF0EB
  --secondary: #4F7DF2 (calm blue)
  --secondary-light: #EEF2FF
  --success: #10B981
  --border: #E5E7EB
  ```
  Use CSS custom properties for the palette.

- **Typography**: System font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`). No external fonts.

- **Layout**: Max-width container (~1100px), centered. Generous whitespace. Mobile responsive (single column on small screens).

- **CTA button**: Prominent, uses accent color, links to GitHub repo.

- **Cards**: Clean with subtle shadows, rounded corners. Grid layout (responsive).

- **Viewport meta tag**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

- **Semantic HTML**: Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.

- **SEO basics**: Proper `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, Open Graph tags for social sharing.

The file should be 300-600 lines total (HTML + inline CSS + inline JS). Keep it tight and polished.

  <name>Task 2: Verify showcase page renders correctly</name>
  <files>docs/index.html</files>
  <action>
  Human verification of the showcase page built in Task 1.

  What was built:
  - Complete showcase page at docs/index.html
  - Hero section with tagline and GitHub CTA
  - Animated workflow demo showing the triage flow
  - Feature highlight cards
  - "Coming soon" teaser
  - "Built by Flo" footer

  How to verify:
  1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (e.g., `open docs/index.html`)
  2. Verify hero section: "Mailroom" title, tagline, "View on GitHub" button works
  3. Scroll to animation: watch the triage workflow demo play through — is it clear and understandable?
  4. Check feature cards: 3-4 cards with descriptions
  5. Check teaser section at the bottom
  6. Check footer: "Built by Flo", no GSD mention
  7. Resize browser to mobile width (~375px): verify responsive layout
  8. Check overall vibe: does it feel product/consumer (Notion, Superhuman) or dev-techy?

  Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe any issues to fix
  </action>
  <verify>Human opens docs/index.html in browser and confirms all sections render correctly, animation plays, and page feels product/consumer not dev-techy</verify>
  <done>Human approves the showcase page design, animation, responsive layout, and overall product-marketing vibe</done>
</task>
