<objective>
Create the root-level project files: a polished README with badges, problem statement, features, and Quick Start; a complete .env.example; AGPL-3.0 LICENSE; and CONTRIBUTING.md.

Purpose: These are the first files any visitor sees. The README must sell the project and orient users. The .env.example enables quick setup. LICENSE establishes the open-core AGPL strategy. CONTRIBUTING.md guides contributors.
Output: README.md, .env.example, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README.md, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
**README.md** — Rewrite the empty README with this structure (keep it concise — small codebase, short docs):

1. **Badges** at the very top (one line, no blank line before):
   ```
   ![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white)
   ![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL--3.0-green)
   ![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/HelloThisIsFlo/mailroom/build.yaml?branch=main&label=build)
   ```

2. **Title**: `# Mailroom` followed by tagline: *One-label email triage for Fastmail*

3. **Showcase link** prominent near top: link to `https://hellothisisflo.github.io/mailroom/` (e.g., "See it in action" or similar)

4. **Problem statement** (2-3 sentences): Reference HEY by Basecamp and Google Inbox as workflow inspiration. Explain that Fastmail is flexible but only filters on arrival. Mailroom brings those powerful triage workflows to Fastmail. Use the user's quote: migrated from HEY, their workflow was amazing, Fastmail is flexible but only filters on arrival. The power of HEY and Google Inbox was really their workflow.

5. **Features** bullet list:
   - JMAP + CardDAV automated pipeline
   - 4 triage destinations (Imbox, Feed, Paper Trail, Jail)
   - Person vs company contact types (@ToPerson label)
   - Retry safety — failed operations auto-retry next poll
   - Fully configurable labels, groups, and polling interval

6. **Quick Start** — Docker first:
   ```bash
   docker run -e MAILROOM_JMAP_TOKEN=... -e MAILROOM_CARDDAV_USERNAME=... -e MAILROOM_CARDDAV_PASSWORD=... ghcr.io/hellothisisflo/mailroom:latest
   ```
   Then "From Source" subsection: clone, `cp .env.example .env`, fill in credentials, `uv sync`, `python -m mailroom`.

7. **Deploy** — one-liner + link to `docs/deploy.md`

8. **Configuration** — one-liner + link to `docs/config.md`

9. **Architecture** — one-liner + link to `docs/architecture.md`

10. **Testing** — `pytest` for unit tests + `python human-tests/test_N_name.py` for integration tests against live Fastmail

11. **License** — AGPL-3.0, link to LICENSE file

12. **GSD footer** at the very bottom: "Built with [GSD](https://github.com/..." — link to GSD repo (use a plausible link or just text "Built with GSD"). Keep it subtle, one line.

Do NOT add a tiny inline diagram — per research recommendation, the Mermaid diagram would add visual weight. Keep it clean, link to architecture.md instead.

**LICENSE** — Copy the exact AGPL-3.0 full text. Name the file `LICENSE` (no extension). This is critical for GitHub's license detection. Use the standard GNU AGPL-3.0 text verbatim. The copyright line should be: `Copyright (C) 2026 Flo Kempenich`.

**CONTRIBUTING.md** — Short file (~30-50 lines):
- Welcome message
- How to set up dev environment (clone, `uv sync --group dev`, `pytest`)
- PR guidelines: use GSD (`/gsd:plan-phase`) for planning to keep the repo coherent
- Reference the `.planning/` directory for project structure/roadmap
- Code style: ruff (already configured in pyproject.toml)
- Human integration tests: mention they run against real Fastmail, reference `human-tests/` directory

  <name>Task 2: Create .env.example with all MAILROOM_ environment variables</name>
  <files>.env.example</files>
  <action>
Create `.env.example` at the project root. Derive all variables from `src/mailroom/core/config.py` MailroomSettings class.

Use the structure from the research (05-RESEARCH.md code example) with these sections:

1. **Header comment**: "Copy to .env and fill in your credentials: cp .env.example .env"

2. **Required Credentials** (no defaults — service won't start without these):
   - `MAILROOM_JMAP_TOKEN=fmu1-your-jmap-token-here` with comment about where to get it (Fastmail Settings -> Privacy & Security -> API tokens)
   - `MAILROOM_CARDDAV_USERNAME=you@fastmail.com` with comment
   - `MAILROOM_CARDDAV_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here` with comment about creating app password (Fastmail Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Integrations -> New app password)

3. **Polling** (commented out with defaults):
   - `# MAILROOM_POLL_INTERVAL=300`

4. **Logging** (commented out with defaults):
   - `# MAILROOM_LOG_LEVEL=info`

5. **Triage Labels** (commented out with defaults):
   - All 5 label vars with their defaults

6. **System Labels** (commented out with defaults):
   - Error and warning labels, warnings_enabled

7. **Screener** (commented out):
   - `# MAILROOM_SCREENER_MAILBOX=Screener`

8. **Contact Groups** (commented out with defaults):
   - All 4 group vars

Cross-reference every field in config.py. There should be 17 configurable fields total (jmap_token, carddav_username, carddav_password, poll_interval, log_level, label_to_imbox, label_to_feed, label_to_paper_trail, label_to_jail, label_to_person, label_mailroom_error, label_mailroom_warning, warnings_enabled, screener_mailbox, group_imbox, group_feed, group_paper_trail, group_jail). That's 18 fields — include all of them.

- README.md contains: badges, tagline, problem statement (HEY/Google Inbox), features list, Quick Start (Docker first), Deploy/Config/Architecture links to docs/, Testing section, License section, GSD footer
- .env.example has all 18 MAILROOM_ env vars matching config.py
- LICENSE is verbatim AGPL-3.0, file named `LICENSE` (no extension)
- CONTRIBUTING.md mentions GSD, dev setup with uv, and human integration tests

<success_criteria>
All four root-level files exist with correct content. README structure matches the locked decisions from CONTEXT.md. .env.example is complete and accurate against config.py.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-add-documentation-deployment-guide-and-project-showcase-page/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
