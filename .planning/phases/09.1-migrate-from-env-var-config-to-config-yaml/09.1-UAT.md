## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Unit test suite passes
expected: Run `pytest` — all 278 tests pass with the new YAML config foundation.
result: pass

### 2. config.yaml loads and app runs
expected: With config.yaml at project root and .env credentials set, running `python -m mailroom` starts the app normally (SSE push or poll cycle begins).
result: pass

### 3. Missing config.yaml fails fast
expected: Rename/remove config.yaml, then run `python -m mailroom`. App exits immediately with a single clear error message (no duplication) pointing to config.yaml.example.
result: pass
retest: true (originally issue — fixed by 09.1-05 gap closure)

### 4. config.yaml.example is documented
expected: `config.yaml.example` exists at project root with inline comments explaining each section (polling, triage categories, labels, logging). Copying it to `config.yaml` gives a working config.
result: pass

### 5. .env.example contains only auth credentials
expected: `.env.example` contains only 3 credential variables: MAILROOM_JMAP_TOKEN, MAILROOM_CARDDAV_USERNAME, MAILROOM_CARDDAV_PASSWORD. No non-secret config (polling, triage, labels) remains.
result: pass

### 6. Human test runs with new config
expected: Run any human test that uses config (e.g., `python human-tests/test_7_screener_poll.py`). It loads settings from config.yaml using nested paths (settings.triage.screener_mailbox, settings.labels.mailroom_error) and executes normally.
result: pass

## Gaps

- truth: "Missing config.yaml exits with a single clear error message"
  status: resolved
  reason: "User reported: Works, wonderful. The error message could be a bit improved, but it's not a huge deal. The error message prints twice."
  severity: minor
  test: 3
  root_cause: "Explicit print() to stderr on lines 312-317 AND raise SystemExit(string) on lines 318-322 both output the message. Python auto-prints SystemExit string args to stderr."
  fix: "09.1-05 — Changed SystemExit(string) to SystemExit(1)"
