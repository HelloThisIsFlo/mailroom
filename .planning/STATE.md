# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log with outcomes in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
v1.1 decisions archived to milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md.

Recent decisions for v1.2:
- `add_to_inbox` does NOT inherit through parent chain (explicit per category only)
- No backward compatibility -- config supports current format only
- Re-triage has no `@MailroomWarning` -- it is a normal supported operation
- Contact notes capture triage history (added/moved with dates)
- CardDAV group reassignment order: add-to-new FIRST, then remove-from-old (safe partial-failure order)

### Pending Todos

5. Sweep workflow: re-label archived emails by contact group membership (area: general) -- far-future idea
7. Migrate to JMAP Contacts API and add programmatic sieve rules (area: api) -- future milestone
12. Deploy Grafana + Loki observability stack (area: deployment) -- deferred to v1.3

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
