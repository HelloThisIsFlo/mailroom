## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: CardDAV is a validation gate (Phase 2) -- do not build triage pipeline until KIND:group model is verified against live Fastmail
- [Roadmap]: Main loop and deployment merged into single phase (Phase 4) -- polling loop is trivial, belongs with packaging

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: CardDAV KIND:group contact model is from training data, not live-verified. Phase 2 must begin with manual prototype against Fastmail before writing pipeline code.
